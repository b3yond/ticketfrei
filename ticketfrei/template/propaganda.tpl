<h1>Features</h1>
<p>
    Don't pay for public transport. Instead, warn each other
    from ticket controllers! With Ticketfrei, you can turn
    your city into a paradise for fare dodgers.
</p>
<p>
    Ticketfrei is a Twitter, Mastodon, Telegram, and E-Mail 
    bot. Users can help each other by tweeting, tooting, 
    messaging, or mailing, when and where they spot a ticket 
    controller.
</p>
<p>
    Ticketfrei automatically spreads those controller reports 
    in the other networks, so others can see them. If there
    are ticket controllers around, they can still buy a ticket
    - but if the coast is clear, they can save the money.
</p>
<h2>How to get Ticketfrei to my city?</h2>
<p>
    We try to make it as easy as possible to spread Ticketfrei
    to other citys. There are four basic steps:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Register on this website to create a bot for your city.</li>
    <li>Create a Twitter, a Telegram, and/or a Mastodon account.</li>
    <li>Log in with the social media accounts you want to
    use for Ticketfrei.</li>
    <li>Promote the service! Ticketfrei only works if there is
    a community for it. Fortunately, we prepared some material
    you can edit, remix, use, and republish:
    <a href="https://github.com/ticketfrei/promotion" target="_blank">https://github.com/ticketfrei/promotion</a>
    <ul>
        <li>If you build cool promotion material yourself, please
        share it with us, so others can use it, too!</li>
    </ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>Our Mission</h2>
<p>
    Public transportation is meant to provide an easy and
    time-saving way to move within a region while being
    affordable for everybody. Unfortunately, this is not yet
    the case. Ticketfrei's approach is to enable people to
    reclaim public transportation.
</p>
<p>
    On short term we want to do this by helping users to avoid
    controllers and fines - on long term by pressuring public
    transportation companies to offer their services free of
    charge, financed by the public.
</p>
<p>
    Because with Ticketfrei you're able to use trains and
    subways for free anyway. Take part and create a new
    understanding of what public transportation could look
    like!
